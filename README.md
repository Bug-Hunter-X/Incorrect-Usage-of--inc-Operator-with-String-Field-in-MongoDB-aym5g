# Incorrect Usage of $inc Operator with String Field in MongoDB
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator in MongoDB.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numeric fields.  Attempting to use it on a string field will result in an error.  The solution shows the proper way to handle updating string fields if needed, potentially using the `$set` operator.

## Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect application of the `$inc` operator to a string field.  This will cause a MongoDB error because `$inc` expects a numerical value.

## Solution
The solution is to use the appropriate operator for updating string fields, in this case, the `$set` operator. The `$set` operator directly assigns a new value to the field, which could involve string manipulation if necessary.
